Installation
============


Build Requirements
------------------
Following packages are required to build LES-IO benchmark.

* MPI compiler (e.g. mpifort)
* NetCDF-C (with parallel support)
* NetCDF-Fortran (with parallel support)


Procedure
---------

(1) Generate Makefile with the ./configure [OPTIONS] script.

[OPTIONS] are listed below. Details are available by ./configure --help

  --prefix=PREFIX         Specify path to installation directory on `make install`

Also, you should provide an installation path to both of NetCDF-{C, Fortran}.

  --with-netcdf=PATH      Specify NetCDF-C path [default=PREFIX]
                          (Example: --with-netcdf=$(HOME)/local)

  --with-netcdff=PATH     Specify NetCDF-Fortran path [default=PREFIX]
                          (Example: --with-netcdff=$(HOME)/local)

(2) make
Now you can see ./LESBENCHMARK in ./src directory.

(3) make install
Or, just execute by ./src/LESBENCHMARK
LES-IO reads a configuration file ./namelist.input in your current directory
For understanding about these configuration formats, please read ./README
