LES-IO Benchmark
================

LES-IO Benchmark is an I/O benchmark that consists of an I/O kernel of City-LES
code [1] in MPI and netCDF.  It generates three-dimensional meteorological data
in the netCDF format.

LES-IO Benchmark is executed in iprocs x jprocs MPI processes.  The number of
processes, problem sizes, and physics model options can be specified by the
'namelist.input' file.

Installation
------------
See INSTALL.

Configuration
-------------
System configuration and simulation configuration can be specified by the
`namelist.input` file.  It consists of three sections;

`parallel` : parallel execution option
`domain`   : domain size
`physics`  : physics model option

`parallel` section
iprocs : number of processes in the horizontal i direction.
jprocs : number of processes in the horizontal j direction.

Note.
  The total number of MPI processes is iprocs x jprocs.

`domain` section
ids      : the start index of whole domain in i-direction.
ide      : the end index of whole domain in i-direction.
jds      : the start index of whole domain in j-direction.
jde      : the end index of whole domain in j-direction.
kds      : the start index of whole domain in k-direction.
kde      : the end index of whole domain in k-direction.
num_soil : number of soil layers.

Note.
  The (ide-ids+1) and (jde-jds+1) should be larger than iprocs and jprocs,
  respectivelys. 
  num_soil option controls the number of soil layers in the model.  The num_soil
  is only effective when soil_model is 1 in physics section.

`physics` section
soil_model : soil model
    1 : enable soil model
    0 : disable soil model
mp_model : cloud microphysics model
    0 : disable cloud microphysics model
    1 : enable cloud microphysics model (warm rain model)
    9 : enable cloud microphysics model (bin model)

Note.
  When soil_model is 1, the num_soil is effective in domain section.
  When mp_model is 1 or 9, the generated data becomes four-dimensional variables
  including the cloud (i.e. cloud moisture).  The output data is larger.
